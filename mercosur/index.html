          A puzzle:
          <span class="text-red-900">Why does Mercosur stay together?</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          Since 1995 Mercosur has kept a common external tariff and an internal free trade area.
          At the same time members routinely threaten to walk away. Uruguay openly explores
          bilateral deals with China and the United States while Brazil and Argentina complain
          about internal asymmetries and sectoral losses. External negotiations stall but the
          customs union does not break.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          The job market paper behind this page asks a simple question: when a customs union
          faces big external partners like China the United States and the European Union
          who really gains from staying inside the bloc and who would rather negotiate alone.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900">What the paper does</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
            The paper builds a quantitative trade model with external bargaining for Mercosur.
            It uses sector level trade data from 2004 to 2017 and simulates counterfactual
            negotiations with China the United States and the European Union. For each
            scenario it compares outcomes when:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-3 space-y-2 text-slate-700 text-sm list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Every member negotiates alone with the partner</li>
            <li>Mercosur negotiates as a single bloc with a common external tariff</li>
            <li>One member deviates while others keep the bloc arrangement</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
            This gives model based measures of gains and losses in real income and sectoral
            profits for each country and lets us ask whether the union is internally stable
            when external offers arrive.

            Uruguay frequently pushes for an independent deal with China while larger

            Luis Lacalle Pou pressing Mercosur partners on the China negotiation.

        <strong class="text-red-900">Key message:</strong>
        Small members like Uruguay tend to gain more in percentage of GDP when Mercosur
        bargains as a bloc while large members gain less and face concentrated losses in
        a few industries. This basic asymmetry already hints at why external talks stall
        without the union dissolving.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900">Mercosur trade policy in practice</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          Mercosur is more than a low tariff club. Members apply a common external tariff
          to most products and commit not to sign independent free trade agreements that
          change those external tariffs unilaterally. This makes any negotiation with
          large partners such as the European Union China or the United States effectively
          a bloc wide decision.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          The paper takes that institutional reality seriously. The counterfactuals always
          respect reciprocity in trade policy and the no import subsidy constraint while
          allowing for asymmetric sectoral tariffs across partners. Internal deviations from
          the common external tariff are modeled explicitly so we can see how one country
          leaving or bending the rule affects everyone else.

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
            In the model the European Union China and the United States each face the
            choice of bargaining with Mercosur as a whole or with individual members.
            The customs union constraint means that a deal with one member can upset the
            internal balance and trigger exit threats by others.

              High profile negotiations with the European Union capture how environmental

          The starting point for the quantitative exercise is detailed bilateral trade data.
          The paper observes flows between Mercosur members and major partners from 2004

          Over this period China becomes a central buyer for South American exports while
          the European Union and the United States remain key destinations for higher
          value manufactures. Within Mercosur Brazil is the main market for neighbors
          industrial goods while Argentina and Uruguay specialize in different baskets
          of agricultural and light manufacturing products.

          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
            Strong growth in demand for soy meat and resource based products makes China
            an especially attractive partner for Uruguay and Brazil and raises the stakes
            of any China Mercosur deal.

            in the mid two thousands that motivates several counterfactuals.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900">Why countries like Uruguay gain from staying</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          The counterfactuals show that when Mercosur negotiates jointly with China or the
          United States the smallest member Uruguay tends to gain more in percentage of
          GDP than Brazil or Argentina. Those gains come both from better access to the
          external partner and from continued preferential access to the large neighbors
          markets.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          Sector level results reveal especially strong increases in profits and employment
          in meat dairy and some manufacturing activities when Uruguay participates in bloc
          negotiations instead of going alone. In the joint China and United States scenarios
          these sectors account for most of the labor reallocation toward expanding export
          opportunities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">

          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-slate-900">Counterfactual thought experiment</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
            Imagine Uruguay signs an independent free trade agreement with China while the
            rest of Mercosur keeps the common external tariff. The model tracks how tariffs
            change across all partners and sectors and recomputes trade flows production and
            wages in every country.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
            Even in that favorable scenario Uruguay still values access to Brazilian and
            Argentine markets. The paper shows that joint bargaining often delivers larger
            aggregate gains than the most optimistic unilateral deviation once the full
            general equilibrium response is taken into account.

          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-slate-900">Link back to the political debate</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
            This helps interpret repeated exit threats by Uruguay. The country can plausibly
            gain in some scenarios by stepping outside the common rule yet the quantitative
            evidence suggests that remaining in the bloc and pushing for serious joint
            negotiations with large partners may generate larger and more resilient gains.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900">Why large members block external negotiations</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          For Brazil and to a lesser extent Argentina the same counterfactuals look very
          different. Average welfare changes from bloc negotiations with China and the
          United States are modest relative to GDP while losses are heavily concentrated
          in a few manufacturing industries such as apparel textiles leather products and
          some machinery.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          The model quantifies those sectoral losses and shows that workers and firms in
          import competing manufacturing lose far more than the aggregate numbers suggest.
          This helps explain why governments that benefit slightly in the aggregate may
          still face intense lobbying against deep external liberalization and why Mercosur
          can stay intact while large negotiations repeatedly stall.

            Within Brazil and Argentina export oriented agriculture and resource sectors
            often gain from lower partner tariffs while urban manufacturing clusters lose.
            The paper uses industry level data to show how those conflicting interests map
            into measurable changes in output profits and employment by sector.

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
            Putting all scenarios together the paper argues that customs unions can be
            internally stable even when they are external negotiation stumbling blocks.
            Small members gain a lot from joint deals and have little incentive to leave
            while large members tolerate the union but use their veto power to protect
            politically sensitive sectors from rapid liberalization.
